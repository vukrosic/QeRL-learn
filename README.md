We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5× speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.

## Installation
**Requirements**

We tested this repo on the following setup:
* Nvidia GPU supports NVFP4 weight format with triton (e.g. RTX 5090, H100, B100...).
* Linux operating system.
* 64 GB RAM.

Other hardware setup could also work but hasn't been tested.

**Environment**

Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/QeRL
cd QeRL
conda create -n qerl python=3.10 -y
conda activate qerl
conda install nvidia/label/cuda-12.4.1::cuda
conda install -c nvidia/label/cuda-12.4.1 cudatoolkit
sh setup_env.sh
```

## Training
**Create a new conda to quantize your own LLM with NVFP4**

Please follow the [instruction](llm-compressor/speed_tests/INSTRUCTION.md) in llmcompressor/instruction.md to buid the quantization tool.

```
cd llm-compressor
conda create -n llmcompressor python=3.12 -y
conda activate llmcompressor

pip install -e .
pip install nvidia-ml-py

python quantize_nvfp4.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
python quantize_nvfp4.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
python quantize_nvfp4.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
python quantize_nvfp4.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct

```

**Training with QeRL**
```
bash training/dapo_qwen2.5-7b_nvfp4_single_gpu.sh
```
**Training with vanilla (16-bit) LoRA**
```
bash training/dapo_qwen2.5-7b_bf16_single_gpu.sh
```

**Hints for QeRL training**

1. Adjust GPU Memory Utilization for Efficient Training: 
You can set different values for the `--vllm-gpu-memory-utilization` parameter in your training script to control the memory usage on your GPUs. For QeRL, it is recommended to set this value smaller than usual since the model uses the NVFP4 format, which is optimized for reduced memory consumption. Lowering this value helps to better utilize memory resources without compromising training stability, especially on GPUs with limited memory capacity.

2. Optimize Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation: 
You can tune the parameters `--perdevice_train_batch_size` and `--gradient_accumulation_steps` to match your available hardware and target effective batch size. If GPU memory is limited, reduce `--perdevice_train_batch_size` and increase `--gradient_accumulation_steps` to reach the desired total batch size. Note that increasing `--gradient_accumulation_steps` **will slow end-to-end training compared to vanilla LoRA**. This is because prefill logits computation still requires dequantization (to be optimized in the future). Striking the right balance between these two parameters is crucial for efficient resource utilization and faster training.

3. Customize Noise Scale and Stages for Dataset-Specific Training: 
QeRL allows you to configure the noise scale parameters `sigma_start`, `sigma_end`, and `num_stages` to tailor the training process to your dataset. Adjusting the noise scale can significantly impact the training dynamics and the quality of the model`s learning. It is recommended to run a few trials with different configurations to determine the optimal settings for your specific dataset.

4. Increase Learning Rate (lr) for Quantized Models:
We found that the optimal learning rate (lr) for QeRL is roughly 10× higher than that used for vanilla LoRA in the same application. This mirrors and extends [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/#:~:text=Our%20experiments%20showed%20that%20the%20optimal%20LR%20for%20LoRA%20is%20consistently%2010x%20the%20one%20used%20for%20FullFT%20in%20the%20same%20application%2C%20for%20both%20supervised%20learning%20and)’ finding that the optimal LoRA LR is consistently about 10× that of FullFT. In QeRL on quantized models, you can safely use a learning rate an order of magnitude higher (about 1e-5 to 3e-5 in our experiments). This accelerates reward improvement, improves training efficiency, and yields more stable RL. In contrast, for 16-bit models, pushing the LR too high—even with LoRA—can cause instability.
