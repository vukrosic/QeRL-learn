ABSTRACT
We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework
for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs’ reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long
rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while
reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the
discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL
introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers
over 1.5× speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to
enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering
overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher
final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of
full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%)
and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an
efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.
Figure 1: Rollout speedup and accuracy of QeRL on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. QeRL achieves faster
RL rollout and end-to-end training speeds (batch=8), while delivering performance superior to
vanilla LoRA and QLoRA, also comparable to full-parameter RL on mathematical benchmarks.
1 INTRODUCTION
The ability to perform multi-step reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to handle
complex tasks, from theoretical problem solving to practical decision making (Sui et al., 2025;
Xu et al., 2025; Chu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2021). Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common
method to improve reasoning by training models to replicate explicit reasoning steps (Huang et al.,
2024d; Min et al., 2024). However, this approach risks promoting imitation rather than encouraging
genuine reasoning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) uses verifiable reward signals to support
adaptive learning, allowing models to explore diverse reasoning traces and identify more robust
solutions (Lambert et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Chen et al., 2025a).

AQN dynamically adjusts quantization noise with an exponential scheduler, enhancing exploration.
RL is effective for LLMs’ reasoning but highly resource-intensive. RL requires substantial GPU
memory, as multiple models, such as policy and reference models in GRPO (Shao et al., 2024),
must run concurrently. The large size of reasoning-focused LLMs (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) further exacerbates memory demands. Training is also slowed by multistage processes, including rollouts,
reward computation, logit evaluation, and gradient updates. Rollouts are particularly costly, involving repeated sampling and processing of long sequences for complex tasks (Yu et al., 2025).
Additionally, RL’s inherent sample inefficiency (Hassani et al., 2024) further increases costs.
Improving RL efficiency in LLMs presents significant challenges. One approach, exemplified by
Tina (Wang et al., 2025), leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) to reduce trainable parameters. However, similar to LoRA in
SFT (Chen et al., 2024b), these methods fail to address the core issue of slow rollout speeds. Another strategy, demonstrated by FlashRL (Liu et al., 2025a), uses quantized rollout models to reduce
computational costs. However, precision mismatches between the rollout model and logits model
(e.g., 8-bit vs. 16-bit) require importance sampling to correct discrepancies, necessitating both 8-bit
and 16-bit models to run simultaneously, which increases memory usage. To overcome these limitations, we focus on lower-bit quantization while avoiding duplicate models in memory. Additionally,
using QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023a) in RL slows rollouts by 1.5–2×, further reducing efficiency.
This slowdown occurs because QLoRA relies on NormalFloat 4-bit (NF4) precision, which requires
unpacking and mapping to floating-point values via a lookup table before matrix multiplication.
To address the limitations of NF4 in QLoRA, a natural solution is to adopt higher-performance quantization. However, standard quantization methods introduce static and deterministic noise, which is
non-beneficial to the later-stage RL training. To avoid this drawback, our analysis surprisingly
reveals that quantization noise, with precise control, can benefit RL by increasing policy entropy
(Fig.3). This added entropy enhances exploration by introducing uncertainty, similar to the effect
of parameter noise in RL (Plappert et al., 2017; Pang & Jiang, 2021), and helps models discover
better strategies (Cui et al., 2025). Our experiments show that a well-designed noise strategy allows quantized LLMs to exploit this effect, reducing memory overhead while gaining better reward
curves. This finding contrasts with results from SFT of LLMs (Dettmers et al., 2023a; Guo et al.,
2023), demonstrating that controllable quantization noise in RL enhances exploration and enables
quantized frameworks to surpass 16-bit LoRA in both efficiency and performance.
We propose QeRL, a quantization-based RL framework designed to train LLMs on reasoning tasks.
As shown in Fig.2, QeRL uses NVFP4 quantization for LLM weights and integrates a Marlinbased (Frantar et al., 2024) approach in both rollout and prefilling stages. This design accelerates
rollout and prefilling without sacrificing accuracy, with gradient backpropagation enabled through
LoRA layers. To address static quantization noise, we introduce adaptive quantization noise (AQN),

which injects channel-wise random noise during training and adjusts exploration noise dynamically
using an exponential schedule. Additionally, we implement a noise-sharing strategy that merges the
noise vector into the layer normalization layer, enabling zero-parameter overhead for noise injection.
Compared to vanilla LoRA, QeRL achieves faster rollout and better reward growth. For example, as
shown in Fig.1, QeRL outperforms QLoRA and vanilla LoRA in rollout and prefilling speeds on the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, achieving a GSM8K score of 90.8—surpassing both 16-bit LoRA and
QLoRA while matching full fine-tuning accuracy on MATH 500. QeRL outperforms vanilla LoRA
and QLoRA in both training speed and reward performance. Notably, it achieves approximately a
1.8× speedup in end-to-end training, compared to QLoRA. Additionally, QeRL demonstrates the
capability to train a 32B model with GRPO on a single H100 80GB GPU.
2 PRELIMINARY
Model Quantization Integer quantization requires mapping float-point weights distributed within
the interval [Wmin,Wmax] to an integer range of 2
N , where N is the target bit-width. Given a
tensor W ∈ R
d×k
, this process is defined as:
W˜ = Round(W
sw
), sw =
Wmax − Wmin
qmax
(1)
where W˜ represents the quantized weight matrix, sW is the scaling factor, and qmax defines the
compressed range. For integer quantization, qmax = 2N − 1. In contrast, for the floating-point
quantization, such as FP4 format, qmax = 6, achieved using a 1-bit mantissa and a 2-bit exponent
(E2M1). 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) is a new data type (Dettmers et al., 2023a), designed for normally
distributed weights. Recently, the latest Blackwell GPU architecture (NVIDIA, 2024) introduces
hardware support for the advanced FP4 format, MXFP4 (Project, 2023) and NVFP4 (NVIDIA,
2024). MXFP4 adopts a shared FP8 (E8M0) scaling factor across parameter blocks of 32 elements,
while NVFP4 employs an FP8 (E4M3) scaling factor with smaller parameter blocks of 16 elements,
enabling finer-grained scaling adjustments compared to MXFP4. Both formats are seamlessly integrated into NVIDIA’s Hopper (NVIDIA, 2023) and Blackwell (NVIDIA, 2024) GPUs.
Low-rank Adaptation LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) is motivated by the observation that weight updates
in large pre-trained models often lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Instead of directly fine-tuning
all parameters, LoRA introduces a low-rank decomposition to model these updates efficiently:
W + ∆W = W + BA (2)
where B ∈ R
d×r
and A ∈ R
r×k
, with the rank r ≪ min(d, k). In this setup, the original weight
matrix W is kept frozen, and only the low-rank matrices A and B are optimized during training.
This formulation drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters and lowers both memory
and computational cost, while retaining the expressivity required for domain adaptation. Within selfattention modules, LoRA is generally applied to the attention and feed-forward projection matrices
(Wq,Wk,Wv,Wo,Wgate,Wup,Wdown), as these layers are the most critical in LLMs. Other
related works are discussed in Appendix D.
3 METHOD
Our experiments reveal that quantized LLMs can significantly enhance exploration in RL. Applying
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to quantized models not only reduces training resource consumption but also outperforms vanilla LoRA in reward growth and evaluation scores (Fig.2). This
3
challenges the conventional view in SFT that quantization degrades training effectiveness(Dettmers
et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2023). Notably, we observe that quantization error functions similarly to
random noise in networks (Plappert et al., 2017; Eberhard et al., 2023; Osband et al., 2016), promoting broader exploration of potential actions or tokens in RL by increasing entropy (Fig.3).
3.1 TRAINING FRAMEWORK OF QERL
QeRL is based on the mainstream policy optimization algorithms of LLMs, such as GRPO (Shao
et al., 2024) and DAPO (Yu et al., 2025).
Group Relative Policy Optimization (Shao et al., 2024) is designed based on the Generalized
Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2015), eliminating the need for a separately trained
reward model, as required in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Engstrom et al., 2019; Schulman
et al., 2017). Instead, for a given input query q, multiple samples are generated, resulting in a set
of candidate outputs {o1, o2, ..., oG}. These candidates are evaluated using a rule-based reward, and
the average reward is used for updates. The optimization objective is defined as follows:
J (θ) = Eq,{oi}[
1
G
X
G
i=1
1
|oi
|
X
|oi|
t=1
(min( πθ(oi,t|q)
πθold (oi,t|q)
Ai,t, clip( πθ(oi,t|q)
πθold (oi,t|q)
, 1 − α, 1 + α)Ai,t)
−βDKL(πθ||πref ))] (3)
where πθ and πref denote the policy model and reference model, respectively, and the clipping range
(1 − α, 1 + α) stabilized the gradient steps of the policy model. KL penalty is used in GRPO to
avoid the unexpected large change in updating (Schulman et al., 2017). Ai,i is the antagonist of i
th
completion, shared across all tokens in ot, defined as:
Ai =
ri − mean({r1, r2, ..., rG})
std({r1, r2, ..., rG})
(4)
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (Yu et al., 2025) suggests higher clipping upper-bond can
help avoid entropy collapse. Another improvement in DAPO is to utilize the loss of token-level
policy gradients. In DAPO, the KL penalty from Eq.3 is removed to eliminate the upper limit on
exploration in RL, thereby encouraging more optional tokens in the rollout process.
3.2 QUANTIZATION ENCOURAGES EXPLORATION
To understand how quantization enhances RL, we analyze its effect on the model’s sampling behavior. Our central finding is that the noise introduced by quantization serves as an implicit exploration
mechanism, similar to explicit noise injection techniques in the parameter and action space (Plappert
et al., 2017; Eberhard et al., 2023; Fortunato et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2025b).
Quantization Improves Sampling Entropy We study 3 different quantization formats of FP4 (NVPF4, MXFP4, and NF4) on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021).

Figure 5: Comparison of RL entropy.
Our empirical study on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Team,
2024) reveals an intriguing finding: when applying PEFTbased RL, models quantized to 4-bit precision consistently outperform their 16-bit counterparts. This advantage is evident across two key metrics: significantly faster
reward convergence during training and higher adjusted
evaluation scores. As shown in Fig.4, the reward curves
of the models exhibit a steeper upward trend compared to
16-bit models, with convergence patterns closely resembling those of full-parameter fine-tuning in both DAPO
and GRPO. Also, NVFP4 and MXFP4 both show better
reward growth than NF4.
This unexpected performance improvement prompted us to investigate the underlying mechanism. We discover that quantization inherently increases the sampling entropy, H(π(|q)) =

can be modeled as static network noise (Fan et al., 2020). This noise propagates across the network
layers, perturbing the final logits before the softmax function is applied. Consequently, the output
probability distribution over the vocabulary, denoted as πθ(|q), becomes ”flatter,” with less pronounced peaks. This increase in sampling entropy plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning by
encouraging exploration (Cheng et al., 2025; Eysenbach & Levine, 2021). It mitigates the model’s
overconfidence in a single ”optimal” token and instead assigns more meaningful probabilities to a
wider range of plausible next actions (Fig.3). The entropy of other model is provided in Appendix H.
Quantization Noise Functionally, this effect resembles exploration in parameters (Eberhard et al.,
2023; Plappert et al., 2017), which deliberately injects noise into parameters to drive exploration:
(θ˜+ θlora) − (θ + θlora) = Q(θ) − θ = ∆ϵ (5)
where Q(θ) denotes the de-quantized weight, and ∆ϵ is the quantization noise. Such exploratory
noise emerges naturally as a computationally “free” byproduct of compressing model representations. This contrasts starkly with SFT, where noise is often detrimental because the objective is to
faithfully imitate the true data distribution rather than to discover novel high-reward outputs.
A key limitation of quantization errors is their deterministic nature, which fails to align with the
dynamic exploration-exploitation trade-off required in RL. Unlike stochastic noise in traditional
RL (Plappert et al., 2017; Osband et al., 2016), which is randomly sampled and independently
applied at different training stages, quantization noise remains static throughout the process, lacking
the adaptability needed to enhance exploration at critical phases.
3.3 ADAPTIVE QUANTIZATION NOISE IN PARAMETER SPACE
To transform static quantization noise into a dynamic exploration mechanism, we introduce an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) technique. The core idea is to introduce a small set of structured
modulation vectors that slightly perturb the otherwise static quantization noise. In our approach, we
utilize an advanced quantization format, NVFP4.
NVFP4 Quantization NVFP4 represents weights using a dual-scaling mechanism: a coarse, pertensor global scaling factor in FP32, SFP32, and a fine-grained tensor of block-wise FP8 (E4M3)
scalers, SE4M3. The dequantization of a 4-bit W˜ to the high-precision Wˆ follows:
Wˆ = Dequant(W˜ ) = SFP32 · (SE4M3 ⊙ W˜ ) (6)
5
where ⊙ denotes block-wise scalar multiplication, broadcasting each scaler in SE4M3 to its corresponding block of 4-bit weights inW˜ . The quantization noise of each weight matrix, ∆ϵ = Wˆ −W,
is the difference between this reconstructed tensor and the original full-precision tensor W.
Adaptive Quantization Noise We introduce a noise vector to the static quantized weight. Specifically, for each quantized linear layer, we sample a stochastic noise vector, Znoisy ∈ R
1×d
, where d
is the input dimension of the layer. This vector is not fixed but is resampled for each forward pass.
We define it as: Znoisy = ϵ, ϵ ∼ N (0, σ2
I), where σ is a hyperparameter in different training stage
governing the noise scale, and ϵ is a random vector whose elements are drawn independently from
a standard Gaussian distribution (Plappert et al., 2017). Then the additive noise is defined as:
∆ϵ
′ = Znoisy + ∆ϵ = Znoisy +

Wˆ − W

(7)
where ∆ϵ
′
is equivalent to the dynamic noise of each weight matrix. In our setting, we freeze the
main branch weight and update the low-rank matrix during RL. The W and Wˆ are consistent values.
In the early stages, we leverage the inherent quantization noise to enhance the model’s exploration
capabilities. As training progresses, σ gradually reduces following an exponential decay scheduler:
σ(k) = σstart ·

σend
σstart  k−1
K−1
(8)
where σstart and σend represent the initial and final noise levels, k is the current stage, and K is the
total interval, which are evenly divided in the training steps (more scheduler comparison in Sec.4.2).
For instance, our experiments in GSM8K with a total of around 600 training steps, noise is injected at
10 evenly spaced intervals, initialized with quantization noise, then from σstart to σend. This approach
aims to balance exploration and exploitation (Fox et al., 2015).

Noise Merging While introducing a noise vector enables dynamic control over quantization
noise, explicitly creating a separate vector for
each quantized layer is not feasible. First, it
imposes a burden on parameter efficiency, increasing memory overhead. Moreover, highprecision noise cannot be directly added to
quantized weights, as this would break the compatibility of our inference kernel designed for
NVFP4 × BF16 operations. We propose a simple solution that integrates this noise vector directly into the layer normalization parameters
of LLM architectures.

By exploiting this equivalency in Eq.9, we subsume the role of Znoisy into the learnable weight
parameter of the LayerNorm operation (e.g. RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019)) that typically
follows the scaling after normalization.

where w represents the scaling factor of RMSNorm. In this configuration, channel-wise additive
noise Znoisy transfers to row-wise multiplicative noise Znoise
w + I of weight (proof provided in Appendix G). Multiplicative noise has been shown to be effective in RL (Pang & Jiang, 2021; Zhang
et al., 2025a). Due to the higher sensitivity of RL to multiplicative noise, we initialize the noise level
with σstart = 1e-2 to ensure stability.
This approach extends adaptive quantization noise to the layer parameters Wq, Wk, Wv, Wgate,
and Wup within each block, as these layers directly interact with normalized activations. To align
with LLM architectures (Team, 2024; Grattafiori et al., 2024), Wq, Wk, and Wv share the same
RMSNorm, while Wgate and Wup share another (as shown in Fig.6).

4.1 EXPERIMENT SETTINGS
RL Training We conducted training experiments using DAPO (Yu et al., 2025) and GRPO (Shao
et al., 2024) on two prominent mathematical reasoning datasets: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and
BigMath (Albalak et al., 2025). GSM8K comprises 7,500 samples with a generation number of 8,
while BigMath includes 122,000 samples with a generation number of 16. Both datasets feature
problems of medium to high difficulty, spanning levels 3 to 5. For GSM8K, we trained 3B and 7B
models, whereas for BigMath, we trained 7B, 14B, and 32B models. Specifically, the 7B and 14B
models were trained on problems ranging from levels 3 to 5, while the 32B model was exclusively
trained on the more challenging level 4–5 problems. Training checkpoints were evaluated between
500 and 1000 steps. To account for the sensitivity of Znoise perturbation, we set its range from 5e-2
to 5e-4 for dynamic noise estimation. In the main experiments, the LoRA rank is fixed at 32. The
speedup tests are performed on a single H100 GPU, while the final evaluated model is trained using
8 H100 GPUs to ensure experimental efficiency on such large-scale data. Detailed hyperparameters
and deployment of QeRL are provided in Appendix E and Appendix F.
Backbone Models We conduct experiments on Qwen2.5 (Team, 2024) series, using basic without
any mathematic data fine-tuning. For weight-only quantization, we applied AWQ (Lin et al., 2024)
to MXFP4 and NVFP4 formats. The calibration dataset included 256 sequences, each 2048 tokens
long, sampled from OpenThoughts-114k (Guha et al., 2025). Weight-only formats also support
inference acceleration on NVIDIA-H100 GPUs with the Marlin kernel (Frantar et al., 2024). For
NF4 quantization, we used the default configuration (Dettmers et al., 2023a).
Evaluation Benchmarks and Metrics We focus on several widely used mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023), AIME
2024/2025 (Li et al., 2024), and AMC 23 (Li et al., 2024), for evaluation. During inference, we use
a temperature of 0.6, completion length of 4096, and top-p sampling with p = 0.95. Each data set
is evaluated multiple times, and we report primarily the average accuracy of one sample (Pass@1).

4.2 EXPERIMENT RESULTS
Reasoning Performance As shown in Tab.1, we report the GSM8k training results of the 3B and
7B models using GRPO. While quantized models exhibit performance degradation compared to
BF16, applying PEFT with RL to the 3B model demonstrates that NVFP4 combined with AQN
achieves a performance of 83.7 from 59.4, surpassing the 76.1 achieved by 16-bit PEFT training
and falling only 0.7 points below full-parameter training. Similarly, for the 7B model, our method
outperforms 16-bit LoRA by 1.7 points. Furthermore, compared to QLoRA, our approach improves
average accuracy by 7.6 and 5.8 points for the 3B and 7B models, respectively. Tab.2 presents
the results on the BigMath dataset for the 7B, 14B, and 32B models trained with DAPO. Across
all datasets, QeRL consistently matches or exceeds the performance of 16-bit models trained with
LoRA. Notably, QeRL trains only about 1% of the parameters required for full-parameter training
while using just 40%–50% of the GPU memory of vanilla LoRA. For the 7B model, QeRL improves
the average score from 25.7 (quantized) to 36.4, compared to 35.7 with vanilla LoRA. Similar trends
are observed in the 14B and 32B models, where QeRL consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA across
benchmarks, further supporting the conclusion that quantization enhances RL. Remarkably, on the
AMC 23 dataset, the 14B model with QeRL achieves 57.5, exceeding 55.0 of full-parameter training.
Reward Visualization In Sec.3.2, we compare the accuracy rewards of quantized LoRA, vanilla
LoRA, and full-parameter training under GRPO and DAPO. Fig.7 presents the accuracy reward
curves for the 7B and 14B models on the challenging BigMath dataset. Notably, QeRL achieves a
rapid reward increase within 200 steps, while vanilla LoRA requires over 500 steps (Appendix H) to
show improvement. This finding highlights that the inherent noise introduced by quantized LLMs
enhances exploration in RL, enabling faster reward growth and higher reward targets.

Noise Decay Schedule Fig.9 compares the performance of different noise decay functions for the 3B
model: linear, exponential, cosine, and logarithmic decay. While their performance differences are
negligible in the early training stages, exponential decay achieves more stable improvements later
by reducing noise to lower levels. The corresponding decay curves are provided in Appendix H.
Ablation of AQN Using default quantized noise throughout the training limits the exploration in
RL. To address this, we propose the AQN. As shown in Fig.8, when we start with the default quantized noise and periodically inject additional noise in later stages, the reward curve grows more
steadily. Notably, when the reward approaches convergence, AQN effectively expands the model’s
exploration space, enabling further improvements in reward.
Ablation of LoRA Rank Fig.10 compares the reward curves of the 3B model during QeRL with
different LoRA ranks. Specifically, ranks of 16, 32, 64, and 128 exhibit similar trends and reward
growth rates, with rank 16 converging slightly faster, making it a more economical choice.
4.3 MEMORY SAVING AND SPEEDUP
Tab.3 compares the quantized model sizes and end-to-end RL training speedup of these PEFT methods, with all experiments conducted on a single NVIDIA H100-80GB GPU (NVIDIA, 2023). For
7B and 14B models, both QLoRA (NF4) and QeRL (NVFP4, supported by the Marlin kernel (Frantar et al., 2024)) significantly reduce memory usage, shrinking the model sizes to 25%–30% of their
16-bit counterparts. Due to the limitations of NF4 generation speed (Egashira et al., 2024), QLoRA
slows to 0.7×–0.8× across different batch sizes. In contrast, QeRL achieves 1.2×–1.5× training
speedups over vanilla LoRA, benefiting from the generation speed of long reasoning sequences.
This efficiency is particularly evident in RL, where the computational demands of long-horizon rollouts emphasize QeRL’s advantage. Notably, our speedup measurements are based on the average
speed during the first 30 steps, where the output token length is relatively short. In later stages of
training, as the model generates longer outputs, the speed advantage of QeRL becomes even more
pronounced. Its dual benefits in memory efficiency and training speed make QeRL highly effective
for end-to-end RL workflows, especially in scenarios requiring extensive rollouts. Fig.11 shows
rollout performance across various LoRA ranks, with QeRL achieving over 2× speedups on 14B
and 32B models. More efficiency comparisons for other models and settings are in Appendix J.

5 CONCLUSION
This paper presents QeRL, an efficient training framework for RL on LLMs, which integrates
NVFP4 precision quantization with LoRA fine-tuning. The framework is based on the novel observation that quantization can enhance exploration during RL, contrary to findings in SFT. Quantized
LLMs not only surpass vanilla 16-bit LoRA training but also approach full-parameter fine-tuning
performance. To address the static nature of quantization noise, we introduce an AQN mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training to enhance RL stability. Extensive experiments
show that QeRL significantly improves accuracy across models of various sizes compared to both
16-bit LoRA and QLoRA. Additionally, with NVFP4 kernel support, QeRL achieves a round a 1.5×
speedup in end-to-end RL training while drastically reducing memory usage.

2025)—exclusively to refine the language, focusing on improving grammar, flow, and tone at the
sentence and paragraph levels. These tools were not employed to generate ideas, design experiments,
or draw conclusions. All technical content, methodologies, and interpretations were independently

D RELATED WORK
Reinforcement Learning for LLMs Recent efforts have focused on enhancing reasoning in
LLMs using RL (Min et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2025). DeepSeekMath (Shao et al., 2024) improves mathematical reasoning by continuing pre-training on math-intensive data and introducing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024). Building on this, DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) demonstrates that RL alone can drive strong reasoning, achieving performance comparable to proprietary models with large-scale training. Complementary system-level
contributions, such as DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), offer an open-source RL framework with a decoupled optimization strategy, achieving competitive results through a simplified training pipeline.
GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025) stabilizes RL training and reduces variance through sequence-level optimization, proving effective in large-scale mixture-of-experts models. HybridFlow (Sheng et al.,
2025) introduces a flexible RLHF framework with hybrid control flow and a 3D-HybridEngine.
Together, these works demonstrate significant progress in advancing LLM reasoning with RL.
Quantization for LLMs Quantization is a key technique for compressing LLMs, improving efficiency by reducing parameter precision. The most common approach, Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ) (Dettmers et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2023; Lin et al.,
2024), transforms pre-trained models cost-effectively without retraining. Recent work has pushed
quantization to ultra-low bit-widths while maintaining performance (Huang et al., 2024c; Dettmers
et al., 2023b; Shang et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024b; Liao & Monz, 2024; Tseng et al., 2024; Huang
et al., 2024a), including advancements in Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to improve robustness (Liu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a). Additionally, novel precision formats like NF4 (Dettmers
et al., 2023a), FP4 (Tseng et al., 2025; Chmiel et al., 2025), and MXFP4 (Chmiel et al., 2025)
enable accurate weight representation, achieving high compression with minimal or improved accuracy loss. NVFP4 (NVIDIA, 2024) is a groundbreaking 4-bit floating-point format introduced
with NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPU architecture. This format expands on the idea of compact, low-bit
”micro” floating-point representations, offering developers enhanced versatility by adding another
flexible option for their projects (Zhang et al., 2025b; Castro et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2024).
15
Efficient Fine-tuning Efficient fine-tuning is pivotal for adapting LLMs with minimal computational cost. LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) pioneered this approach by adding low-rank adapters to frozen
weight matrices. DoRA (Liu et al., 2024) improved upon this by decomposing weight updates
into directional and magnitude components, addressing low-rank constraints and enhancing stability. QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023a) integrated LoRA with 4-bit quantization to further reduce
resource usage, while LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2024b) introduced fine-tuning methods for longcontext processing. Tina (Wang et al., 2025) demonstrated that compact models could gain reasoning ability through RL with LoRA. Beyond the LoRA family (Hu et al., 2022), other efficient
fine-tuning techniques include prompt tuning, prefix tuning, IA3, BitFit, Fisher-masked tuning, and
input-tuning (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Zaken et al., 2022; Sung et al.,
2021; An et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023). These advancements underscore the importance of efficient
fine-tuning for practical LLM adaptation.
E EXPERIMENT HYPERPARAMETERS
Training Data and Reward Function We trained the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7BInstruct, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct models, which are widely used for
evaluating reasoning capabilities. Unlike other studies that rely on math-specialized models, we
aim to evaluate training performance starting from general-purpose base models. Additionally,
QeRL can be smoothly transferred to other model families, such as the Qwen3 series. For the
GSM8K dataset, we primarily trained the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models
using GRPO, while for the BigMath dataset, we focused on training the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct models using DAPO. Specifically, for the 7B
and 14B models, we selected data with medium to high difficulty levels (grades 3–5), and for
the 32B model, we used high-difficulty data (grades 4–5). For problem prompts, we append the
suffix Solve the following math problem step by step. The reasoning
process and direct answer are enclosed within <think> </think>
and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning
process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>: <think> ...
</think> <answer> ... </answer>.
RL Training Configuration For both GRPO and DAPO, we use the hyperparameters in Tab.4,
without using entropy or KL losses. For 4-bit training, the learning rate is set to 1e
−5
. However,
due to the fragile of the BF16 model with LoRA, the learning rate can not be larger than 5e
−6
, or it
will collapse in the late training stage.

F DEPLOYMENT OF QERL
In Algorithm 1, we provide a detailed explanation of how QeRL is deployed within the GRPO
framework. During the steps in stage 0, the added noise σ is set to 0, where only quantization noise
effects. At stage 1, σ is initialized to σstart, and by the final stage (K-1) σ gradually transitions to
σstart. This progressive adjustment of noise ensures a structured and controlled exploration process
throughout the training stages, balancing stability and exploration effectively.

G PROOF OF NOISE SHARING
In this section, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of the noise-sharing operation proposed in
Eq.10, detailing the process by which additive noise is transformed into multiplicative noise. With
AQN, input of each block follows:
RMSNormnoise(X) = (Znoise
w
+ I) ⊙ RMSNorm(X), (11)
where RMSNorm(·) denotes the vanilla RMSNorm operation and w is the original scaling factor
in RMSNorm(·). The element-wise multiplication (⊙) will be auto-broadcast during computing.
Then, the operation of the following linear computation is defined as:
((Znoise
w
+ I) ⊙ RMSNorm(X)) · Wˆ = RMSNorm(X) · ((Znoise
w
+ I)
⊤ ⊙ Wˆ ), (12)
Thus, the additive Gaussian noise, when incorporated into the noise-sharing mechanism of LayerNorm, can be equivalently regarded as multiplicative Gaussian noise (denoted as (
Znoise
w + I)) and
applied row-wise to the weight matrix Wˆ . Since RMSNorm is only applied to the inputs of each
attention block and feed-forward network (FFN) block, this mechanism ensures that the Q, K, and
V matrices in the attention block share the same noise, while the down and up layers in the FFN
block also share a single, identical noise set. This noise-injection strategy avoids disrupting the
multiplication kernels of NVFP4 and BF16 in QeRL or introducing additional matrix multiplication
operations.
Both additive and multiplicative noise have been shown to positively contribute to exploration in
RL (Plappert et al., 2017; Higuera et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2025b). However, multiplicative noise
tends to be more sensitive, especially in deep networks like LLMs. To address this, we initialize
the noise standard deviation (σ) to 1e-2, which is smaller than the typical 1e-1 used in traditional
noise-based networks.

rewards of the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on the BigMath dataset with difficulty levels ranging
from 3 to 5, as an extension of Fig.7. Leveraging the exploration benefits of QeRL in quantized
models, a rapid increase in reward is observed after approximately 200 steps, whereas 16-bit LoRA
requires over 500 steps to achieve a similar rise. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig.13, we trained the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model on the highest difficulty data (levels 4–5). Although the difference
in reward growth between QeRL and LoRA is less pronounced in the 32B model compared to the
smaller 3B, 7B, and 14B models, QeRL still consistently performs better than LoRA.

More Experiments of Entropy As an extension of
Fig.5, Fig.14 illustrates the entropy curve of the Qwen2.5-
14B-Instruct model at various training steps. Notably, the
entropy of QeRL remains consistently higher than that of
LoRA throughout the RL process, particularly during the
initial steps. This observation highlights the advantage of
QeRL in promoting exploration during RL, as higher entropy indicates a broader search of the solution space. The
increased exploratory capacity facilitated by quantization
appears to enable the model to navigate complex environments more effectively, ultimately supporting improved
optimization. These results further validate the role of quantization in enhancing the explorationexploitation balance in RL tasks.

Noise Scheduler Fig.15 illustrates the noise
scheduler employed in our experiments, showing four distinct decay strategies: linear, exponential, cosine, and logarithmic. The scheduler
adjusts the noise level in 10 stages to guide the
training process. The linear decay method reduces noise uniformly across stages, ensuring a
consistent rate of change. The exponential decay rapidly decreases the noise at the beginning
and uses smaller noise scales in later stages,
which we found effective for achieving stable
and higher rewards in later stages of training.
The cosine decay follows a smooth oscillatory
pattern, gradually reducing noise with a cosine curve, whereas the logarithmic decay decreases noise
sharply in early stages and stabilizes in later ones. Among these, we chose the exponential decay
strategy due to its ability to maintain smaller noise scales during the later stages, resulting in a more
stable and higher reward curve. This flexibility in controlling noise levels plays a critical role in
balancing exploration and convergence during training.
I ADDITIONAL ABLATION STUDY
Ablation of Learning Rate We examine the impact of learning rate variations on the performance
of quantized models compared to 16-bit models. As illustrated in Fig.16 and Fig.17, with a relatively
small learning rate of 5e-6, QeRL marginally outperforms LoRA, achieving a reward close to 0.95.

When the learning rate is increased to 3e-5, the larger update magnitude in the adapter results in
faster reward growth and quicker model convergence. However, in 16-bit models, the excessive
update magnitude leads to instability, often causing the training process to collapse. In contrast,
QeRL demonstrates remarkable robustness to larger learning rates due to the presence of NVFP4
quantization noise, which helps stabilize updates. This robustness enables QeRL to maintain stable
training even under high learning rates, achieving a reward growth rate nearly twice as fast as the
16-bit model. These results underscore QeRL’s superior adaptability and efficiency, particularly in
challenging training scenarios with high learning rates.

employ gradient checkpoint to accelerate computation. For training on GPUs with smaller memory
capacity, enabling gradient checkpointing is recommended to reduce memory usage, although this
may come at the cost of slower overall training speed. During the rollout phase, the precision of
NVFP4, optimized by the Marlin kernel (Frantar et al., 2024), demonstrates a significant acceleration, achieving speeds of 1.0 to 2.0×. In particular, performance gains become more pronounced
as model size increases, with the 32B model achieving up to a 2.0× speedup. This indicates that
NVFP4’s advantages are particularly impactful for large-scale models, where computational demands are higher.
In end-to-end RL efficiency evaluation, we report the per-step latency of GRPO training, defined as
the wall clock time to complete an optimization step including rollout generation, log-probability
computation, and parameter updates. We benchmark with rollout batch sizes of 2 and 8 while fixing
the maximum input length to 256 tokens and the maximum completion length to 2,048 tokens. For
fairness, we match the vLLM memory budget between BF16 and NVFP4 variants by setting the
same gpu memory utilization in the engine: 0.20 for Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, 0.30 for 7B, 0.45 for
14B, and 0.40 for 32B (the latter to enable single-GPU training). Under these controlled settings,

the E2E latency reductions mirror the rollout phase acceleration and become more pronounced as
the model size grows, with the largest gains observed on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.
Additionally, Tab.9 provides a comparison of inference speeds between 16-bit and NVFP4 main
models across various LoRA ranks. NVFP4 consistently outperforms 16-bit models in terms of
speed at all adapter ranks, showcasing its ability to maintain efficiency across diverse configurations. However, as the rank increases, both NVFP4 and BF16 experience a gradual decline in rollout
speed within the vLLM engine, likely due to the increased computational overhead associated with
higher ranks. Despite this, NVFP4 continues to demonstrate superior performance, highlighting its
robustness and adaptability for both small-scale and large-scale setups. These findings underscore
NVFP4’s potential to optimize inference efficiency, particularly when combined with advanced kernels and varying adapter configurations.
K LIMITATION ANALYSIS
We have demonstrated that our method, QeRL, achieves superior performance in RL training for
LLMs compared to 16-bit vanilla LoRA training. Additionally, QeRL matches the accuracy of 16-
bit full-parameter reinforcement fine-tuning while delivering over 2× training speedup relative to
both vanilla LoRA and QLoRA. However, since RL for LLMs inherently demands significantly
greater computational resources than SFT, our experiments, conducted on model sizes ranging from
3B to 32B, do not yet establish whether QeRL can maintain the same level of performance for models exceeding 70B parameters, leaving that investigation for future work. Another limitation is that
RL training often requires tens or even hundreds of hours, and while we have provided comprehensive evaluations on reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH 500, AIME 24, AIME 25, and
AMC 23, we did not extend our evaluations to other benchmarks or data types, such as code, or to
general-purpose language tasks unrelated to reasoning. Nevertheless, our technique can be seamlessly adapted to richer and more diverse training datasets. We encourage the community to explore
and apply this method to a broader range of tasks in future research.
